  <p>
  Hey! I'm a Computer Science graduate specializing in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, passionate about securing real-world systems and understanding how attackers think.
</p>
<p>
  I work across offensive and defensive security, with hands-on experience in vulnerability assessments, SIEM-based monitoring, enterprise infrastructure, and cloud environments. I care deeply about practical security, clear documentation, and building defenses that actually work.
</p>
<p>
  Recent highlights include discovering critical vulnerabilities during security assessments, contributing to enterprise security evaluations, and co-authoring research on LLM prompt-injection attacks focused on adversarial behavior in modern AI systems.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of research and assessments, I actively practice through CTFs and lab environments, exploring Linux, Windows, networking, and exploitation techniques. Always learning—and always excited to collaborate on meaningful security problems.
